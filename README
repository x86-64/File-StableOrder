    my $foo = File::StableOrder->new(
    	filename => "file.txt",
	mode     => "r",          # "r", "rw", "w"
	...
	# for Read-Write
	truncate => 1, # truncate file if there are previous results in file OR
	continue => 1, # continue processing from last element OR
	merge    => 1, # merge info from temporary file into main
	output_filename => "output.txt",  #  use this file to store results. original file will be unchanged
    );
    ...
    $foo->rewind;                           # start from beginning of file
    while(my $item = $foo->readline()){     # read item,
       $item->{i} = int($item->{i}) + 1;    # process it,
       
       $foo->returnline($item);             # and return
    }
    $foo->finish;                           # save results and rewind to start
